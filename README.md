# liri-node-app
LIRI is a Server Side Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 
LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies in order to provide a back end data source of information on demand for marketing and current local user app updates.
To retrieve the data that will power this app, send requests will be made using the axios package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. 
Current Data Source Overview:
    Node-Spotify-API
    Axios-Axios will grab data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API
